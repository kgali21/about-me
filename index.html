        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! My name is Kamran George Ali, I was born and raised in Beaverton, Oregon.
            I graduated from Southridge High School in 2010, I then got my transfer degree from PCC,
            and then i transferd over to the Art Institute of Portland which i graduated with a degree
            in 3D modeling in 2017. I then decided to take some time off from school while I tried to
            find a job in that position, in the mean time i worked at McMenamins as a cook, server, trainer,
            and a line cook. I decided i needed to change my life, so I joined Alchemy Code Academy!

        <h3>My Journey with Code</h3>
        <p>
            In high school, I was really trying to figure out what I wanted to do. At the time, all I wanted to do was
            play World of Warcraft all day but realized thats incredibly unrealistic. So I decided to take a coding
            class. This class turned out to be one of the only classes I actually passed without trying 
            too hard. I then started to dabble in art and drawing, and learned I really liked doing that so I called
            it quits from coding. It didn't actually hit me that this is what I wanted to do with my life until
            I came to Alchemy and started coding again.
